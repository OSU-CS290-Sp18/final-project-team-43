                        The association between race and citizenship in the United States evolved towards an attitude of civic nationalism and became more consistent with the Enlightenment values from which the nation was founded over the course of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. This evolution started from the early 20th century, in which African Americans were still legally segregated from the rest of the population, race was placed into heavy consideration for immigration, and the ideas of civic nationalism began to propagate in the United States. This trend continued into the mid-20th century, when the civil rights movement became an integral piece of mainstream politics. The late-20th century and early 21st century showed the greatest shift in attitudes toward race and nationality, with the majority support of widespread legal equality.
                        Race and citizenship were considered by some to be widely separate however the propagation of civic nationalism in the early 20th century began to change this. Madison Grant claimed in “The Passing of the Great Race” that racial heterogeneity was an ultimately negative trait of a society, and that individuals who did not belong to the “Nordic” race were detrimental to the nation.  In “Whose Country is This?”, Calvin Coolidge stated “Such a background might consist either of a racial tradition or a national experience, but in its lowest terms it must be characterized by a capacity for assimilation”  which demonstrated a clear rhetoric in favor of civic nationalism, however was not devoid of racial preference. A. Philip Randolph stated in “Why We Should March” that “By fighting for our rights now, American negroes are helping to make America a moral and spiritual arsenal of democracy.”  This demonstrated the beginning of the fight for civil rights during the Second World War, as military service worked to further unify and integrate different ethnic groups to a greater extent than previously before, and demonstrated a massive development since the beginnings of the 20th century. The early 20th century demonstrated a transition from sentiments of racial nationalism to the beginning of a civic nationalist mindset, and then the beginning of the civil rights movement and racial justice during World War II which would then lead to the central events in this evolution of race and nationalism in the mid-20th century.
                        The mid-20th century continued this evolution of race and citizenship though the continued progression of civil rights for racial minorities, particularly for African Americans. This continued the trend of further fulfilling the Enlightenment value of individual rights and equality under the law. “The Southern Manifesto” discussed the Supreme Court’s abolition of segregation with extreme distaste, which demonstrated a continued sentiment against absolute equal treatment under the law, however also showed the continued trend of further integration of racial groups into the wider public through the repeal of segregation in the South.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was put into place under Lindon Johnson, which acted as a response to the continued pressure from activist movements, and expanded the amount protections for all people, though especially racial minorities and banned workplace discrimination based on any innate characteristics such as race and sex.  These developments in civil rights in the United States contribute to the evolution of the relationship between race and citizenship in America through the continued progression of civil rights. The progression of civil rights in the mid-20th century allowed for the continued progression of Enlightenment principles such as equal treatment by the legal system. This was demonstrated through the abolition of segregation as well as the implementation of the Civil Rights Act, as both acts set a more equal precedent from which individuals of any background could strive. 
                        The late 20th century and early 21st century end this evolution of the relationship between race and citizenship, as a mainstream embrace of civic nationalist values are upheld and a wider cultural precedent for equality and individualism is shown. In “A Democratic Agenda for the 1990s” it stated, “We endorse Jackson’s credo of equal opportunity for all, and special privileges for none” and “We believe in the protection of civil rights and the broad movement of minorities into American’s economic and cultural mainstream, not racial, gender, or ethnic separatism.”  This demonstrated a drastic shift in public attitude from the beginning of the 20th century, as not only civil rights and equality were emphasized, but were used as a means to appeal to a voting demographic, which implied that a large amount of the United States greatly favored these notions in their society. The continued theme of working to further realize equality is found in the early 21st century as well, as an increasing number of Americans regardless of ethnicity have shown to hold the sentiment that more action should be taken to achieve greater racial equality among ethnic groups.  This contributes to the trend of the evolution of race and citizenship, as sentiments for racial equality and fairness became the majority opinion for Americans, with not only the emphasis of integration of different peoples, but also the improvement of the quality of life under the law.
                        The association between race and national identity in the United States evolved towards an attitude of civic nationalism and became more consistent with the Enlightenment values from which the nation was founded over the course of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. The early 20th century saw the development from racial nationalism to the beginning of civic nationalism and a greater integration along with the beginning of pursuit of civil rights and legal equality. The mid-20th century demonstrated the further progression of civil rights and anti-discrimination, which progressed value of individual freedom and equality protected under the law. The late 20th and early 21s centuries demonstrated the shift if the United States’ mainstream consideration for continued improvement for equality for ethnic groups, which demonstrated the drastic evolution of the attitude between race and citizenship.

                    The global role of the United States from the Second World War to the Vietnam war was ultimately that of a global policeman. This new role replaced the previous and predominant isolationist attitude, regardless of large amounts of debate and opposition. Despite the opposition to this attitude, the overall fate of the country became one of international intervention. Individuals who opposed the global intervention of the United States considered the negative implications of such actions as too detrimental. Individuals that supported this role considered the United States to be a benevolent force in the world whose responsibility it was to propagate and defend democracy and capitalism, as well as to contain the growth of communism in the world. The interventionist actions of the United States military in the world demonstrated its newfound role, which it maintained throughout this time period.
                    The opposition to the global intervention of the United States was driven primarily by the fear of unwanted consequences created by such intervention. Charles Lindbergh opposed United States intervention in World War II and stated, “We have weakened ourselves for many months, and still worse, we have divided our own people by this dabbling in Europe’s wars.”  This non-interventionist sentiment demonstrated warns that intervention would only work to weaken the United States. Walter Lippman states in “The Cold War: A Study in U.S. Foreign Policy” that “We shall have either to disown our own puppets, which would be tantamount to appeasement and defeat and the loss of face or must support them at an incalculable cost on an unintended , unforeseen and perhaps undesirable issue.” The concern presented by Lippman was that in the United States’ pursuit of world influence, would create many unnecessary complications that would not only hurt the United States’ reputation as a power, but would also force the country to stay in a perpetual state of global intervention. Despite the anti-interventionist sentiments present both before and after World War II, the United States would continue to push into more global affairs, in confronting both Nazism and Communism, which overruled these critical opinions. 
                    Those who supported United States global intervention considered it to be a necessity for global prosperity. Franklin D. Roosevelt, in “Annual Message to Congress” put forth the idea that the purpose for United States intervention was to uphold certain fundamental human freedoms which were opposed by authoritarian regimes.  This sentiment led the United States to later intervention in the war, and then the world. Harry Truman outlines in the Truman Doctrine that the United States is a necessary component for the “peaceful development of nations, free from coercion”, and goes onto emphasize that self determination is one of the most important principles that must be upheld by the United States in the world.  Both of these documents put forward the idea that it was the United States’ responsibility to bring prosperity and freedom to the rest of the world and insure certain liberties to all. Both documents were put forward by two leaders of the nation, demonstrating that the federal government itself held interest in propagating US presence within the world. The interventionist sentiment fueled the United States eventual role in becoming the moderator of the world.
                    Although the debate between interventionists and anti-interventionists was a prominent part of American existence, the United States continued to intervene in world affairs. The beginning of the Second World War began discussions of intervention, but it was not until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that United States entered the War.  After the end of the World War II, and the beginning of the Cold War, the United States made it its mission to propagate democracy and oppose the Soviet Union’s expansion, as shown in the Allied occupation of Germany.  The United States would continue to fight in two interventionist wars, the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Both wars were acts that opposed the expansion of communism in the world, as the new mission of the United States became combating this expansion. Although these actions showed the persona of the United States to the world, they were not unconstrained by the public. Anti-war sentiments towards Vietnam became more prominent  and began to affect the decisions of the federal government’s actions in continuing the war.  In spite of this opposition towards intervention in Vietnam, the United State had already established its role in the international community. The continued international intervention that the US demonstrated that the role of the country, decided by the federal government, was that of a world’s policeman. 
                    The global role of the United States from the Second World War to the Vietnam war was ultimately that of a global policeman. This international role was supported primarily by those in the federal government that wished to propagate American values in the world and fight the expansion of authoritarian regimes like the Nazis and the Soviets. This acted in opposition to the sentiments held by those who feared the negative consequences of excessive foreign intervention, in that such intervention would not only weaken the country but place it perpetual conflict. The actions of the United States government through military intervention demonstrate its true role in the world, regardless of domestic sentiments. The occupation and reconstruction of Germany and the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War demonstrated through action that the United States would intervene in an increasing amount of conflicts that held priority. These global actions were not unconstrained, as shown by the withdrawal of the military in Vietnam, caused by public anti-war sentiments. The overarching theme, despite public and democratic constraints, was that the United States became increasingly more interventionist, and demonstrated its role in trying to uphold and enforce certain principles and ideas in the world, as a kind of global policeman.
