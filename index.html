                        The association between race and citizenship in the United States evolved towards an attitude of civic nationalism and became more consistent with the Enlightenment values from which the nation was founded over the course of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. This evolution started from the early 20th century, in which African Americans were still legally segregated from the rest of the population, race was placed into heavy consideration for immigration, and the ideas of civic nationalism began to propagate in the United States. This trend continued into the mid-20th century, when the civil rights movement became an integral piece of mainstream politics. The late-20th century and early 21st century showed the greatest shift in attitudes toward race and nationality, with the majority support of widespread legal equality.
                        Race and citizenship were considered by some to be widely separate however the propagation of civic nationalism in the early 20th century began to change this. Madison Grant claimed in “The Passing of the Great Race” that racial heterogeneity was an ultimately negative trait of a society, and that individuals who did not belong to the “Nordic” race were detrimental to the nation.  In “Whose Country is This?”, Calvin Coolidge stated “Such a background might consist either of a racial tradition or a national experience, but in its lowest terms it must be characterized by a capacity for assimilation”  which demonstrated a clear rhetoric in favor of civic nationalism, however was not devoid of racial preference. A. Philip Randolph stated in “Why We Should March” that “By fighting for our rights now, American negroes are helping to make America a moral and spiritual arsenal of democracy.”  This demonstrated the beginning of the fight for civil rights during the Second World War, as military service worked to further unify and integrate different ethnic groups to a greater extent than previously before, and demonstrated a massive development since the beginnings of the 20th century. The early 20th century demonstrated a transition from sentiments of racial nationalism to the beginning of a civic nationalist mindset, and then the beginning of the civil rights movement and racial justice during World War II which would then lead to the central events in this evolution of race and nationalism in the mid-20th century.
                        The mid-20th century continued this evolution of race and citizenship though the continued progression of civil rights for racial minorities, particularly for African Americans. This continued the trend of further fulfilling the Enlightenment value of individual rights and equality under the law. “The Southern Manifesto” discussed the Supreme Court’s abolition of segregation with extreme distaste, which demonstrated a continued sentiment against absolute equal treatment under the law, however also showed the continued trend of further integration of racial groups into the wider public through the repeal of segregation in the South.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was put into place under Lindon Johnson, which acted as a response to the continued pressure from activist movements, and expanded the amount protections for all people, though especially racial minorities and banned workplace discrimination based on any innate characteristics such as race and sex.  These developments in civil rights in the United States contribute to the evolution of the relationship between race and citizenship in America through the continued progression of civil rights. The progression of civil rights in the mid-20th century allowed for the continued progression of Enlightenment principles such as equal treatment by the legal system. This was demonstrated through the abolition of segregation as well as the implementation of the Civil Rights Act, as both acts set a more equal precedent from which individuals of any background could strive. 
                        The late 20th century and early 21st century end this evolution of the relationship between race and citizenship, as a mainstream embrace of civic nationalist values are upheld and a wider cultural precedent for equality and individualism is shown. In “A Democratic Agenda for the 1990s” it stated, “We endorse Jackson’s credo of equal opportunity for all, and special privileges for none” and “We believe in the protection of civil rights and the broad movement of minorities into American’s economic and cultural mainstream, not racial, gender, or ethnic separatism.”  This demonstrated a drastic shift in public attitude from the beginning of the 20th century, as not only civil rights and equality were emphasized, but were used as a means to appeal to a voting demographic, which implied that a large amount of the United States greatly favored these notions in their society. The continued theme of working to further realize equality is found in the early 21st century as well, as an increasing number of Americans regardless of ethnicity have shown to hold the sentiment that more action should be taken to achieve greater racial equality among ethnic groups.  This contributes to the trend of the evolution of race and citizenship, as sentiments for racial equality and fairness became the majority opinion for Americans, with not only the emphasis of integration of different peoples, but also the improvement of the quality of life under the law.
                        The association between race and national identity in the United States evolved towards an attitude of civic nationalism and became more consistent with the Enlightenment values from which the nation was founded over the course of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. The early 20th century saw the development from racial nationalism to the beginning of civic nationalism and a greater integration along with the beginning of pursuit of civil rights and legal equality. The mid-20th century demonstrated the further progression of civil rights and anti-discrimination, which progressed value of individual freedom and equality protected under the law. The late 20th and early 21s centuries demonstrated the shift if the United States’ mainstream consideration for continued improvement for equality for ethnic groups, which demonstrated the drastic evolution of the attitude between race and citizenship.
