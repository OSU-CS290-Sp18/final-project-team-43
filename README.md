Final Project for CS 290- Team 43 (Tim and Eliza)

The project that we chose to make was a blog.

The layout is a navbar at the top with a main scroll page that contains all the posts written on the blog.
There is a search feature that allows for the user to type in a string and any blogs that pertain to the search query will appear in the main scroll.

This project is terrible and I want to die.
